                    "This class never ended. First of all, she was so dry. I happened to like the material we were reading, but she would go on and on about things for way too long. She would ask a question and when nobody responded, would just sit in an awkward silence for a while. Also, while not necessary, I personally would’ve liked it if she were a bit more personable instead of stiff, all-business all the time. She was also a little too stringent with points. For example, I once turned in an essay four minutes after the due minute and she took off 5% for lateness. I might have been okay with that if not for the fact that she herself took months to grade anything and never finished grading by the due date at the end of the marking period. One thing that I both liked and disliked at times is that she grades everything in meticulous detail instead of by completion. It was nice to get feedback but that meant it was really easy to  lose points for small things." <br> <br>

                    "grades her whole regular class like her honors class. We had a 5 paragraph essay and gave half of the class a very poor grade on it and didn’t make any comments as to why. She needs to stop grading us so harshly, I really struggle in this class. Not only is she bad at grading but is also very stand offish and won’t have a heart to heart conversation with her students and does not put in the effort to have her students succeed. If it wasn’t so far into the school year I would’ve dropped out of her class if i knew this is what the work would be like. I was in honors la last year and dropped out to go into advanced and the work is a lot harder then my work last year and it’s supposed to be an easier class. Not only that but she gave her regular class a 60 word vocab test that she said weeks before that we were not going to have a test on this. She did not give her honors class a 60-word vocab test" <br> <br>
